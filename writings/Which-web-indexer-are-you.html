  <h1 class="PageTitle">Which Web indexer are you?</h1>
               
        <div><blockquote>There are many reasons to use PeARS and start indexing the Web. But what is yours? Read the following profiles, and discover which Web indexer <i>you</i> are!</blockquote></div><br>

        <p><b>The librarian</b> The indexer by excellence. You worry days and nights about those billions of Web pages that sit uncatalogued on dubious servers.</p>

        <p><b>The odd one out</b> Fate forgot to make you a beautifully average human being, so the Internet doesn't like you. You like curling, it gives you football; you like kinky, it gives you straight (hair, or whatever else); you like gloomy, it gives you puppies. You dream of having your own private gloomy kinky curling Web.</p>
   
        <p><b>The prepper</b> You have recently bought land in New Zealand, built a bunker, and now need a copy of the entire Web to sustain you while the atomic cloud slowly subsides. You like the idea of getting together with other preppers to index prepping websites and websites about indexing prepping websites. Because you can never be too prepared.</p>

        <p><b>The altruist</b> </p>

        <p><b>The marxist</b> </p>

        <p><b>The responsible adult</b> Those little devils are supposed to browse the Web for their school project, but they will inevitably end up on some Pokemon websites. </p>

        <p><b>The player</b> You think it's all a game, and you're sure gonna win. The other guy is making a Star Trek pod? <i>Your</i> Star Trek pod will be better and bigger. </p>

        <p><b>The aesthete</b> You really don't care about the Web. But you do care about beauty and you can nearly visualise what it would mean for millions of people to choreographically grasp a handful of websites and throw them at each other like a giant, intricate flower opening up. You long for the silent apotheosis of revolutions and the inevitable void that lies beyond.</p>

        <p><b>The libertarian</b> </p>

        <p><b>The galactic emperor</b> You first name is Darth. You really don't like the idea that knowledge might be owned by the people. You have already designed a plan to make better pods, with more power and more glitter, and a backdoor that lets you control them at a distance. Your pods will be called TeARS and have cute in-built smileys that do not smile, and you will cry them. You will say you always loved decentralisation and it was all your idea in the first place. You might turn out to be useful.</p>
