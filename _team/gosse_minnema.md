Gosse is a computational linguist who likes to think about, code, and model meaning in societally meaningful ways, and is expected to defend his PhD thesis at the University of Groningen (The Netherlands) very soon. In his free time, he often laments the lack of mountains in the Netherlands and (not very) secretly enjoys beverages that are most popular with Italian grandmas (cool cedrata in summer, hot orzo coffee in winter).
